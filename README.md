# Kent Beck's Best Practice Patterns in Ruby

This repo contains patterns from Kent Beck's book *Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns* implemented in Ruby. This is purely for educational purposes, allowing me to study both Ruby and these patterns simultaneously. While all Ruby code is written by me, credit for the patterns and concepts themselves belong entirely to Kent Beck.

## Behavior

> Objects model the world through behavior and state. Behavior is the dynamic, active, computational part of the model. State is what is left after behavior is done, how the model is represented before, after, and during a computation. Of the two, behavior is the more important to get right.

## Messages

> Messages are the heartbeat of a Smalltalk program...When you learn to see your program in terms of patterns of messages and you learn what can be done to that stream of messages to solve problems, then you will be able to solve any problem you can imagine in Smalltalk.
