# Kent Beck's Best Practice Patterns in Ruby

This repo contains patterns from Kent Beck's book *Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns* implemented in Ruby. This is purely for educational purposes, allowing me to study both Ruby and these patterns simultaneously. While all Ruby code is written by me, credit for the patterns and concepts themselves belong entirely to Kent Beck.

## Behavior

> Objects model the world through behavior and state. Behavior is the dynamic, active, computational part of the model. State is what is left after behavior is done, how the model is represented before, after, and during a computation. Of the two, behavior is the more important to get right.
